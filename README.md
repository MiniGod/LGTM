Looks Good To Me
================

A collection of LGTM macro images since I don't like the ones on LGTM.in

Check it out [here](http://koddsson.github.io/LGTM/).

Contributing
------------

If you have some awesome LGTM images feel free to make a PR! I'll be happy to
merge it so long as the code doesn't break and I like the images (I'm
particularly fond of GIFs).

Don't hesitate to open up issues for anything that needs clarification or
isn't working as you'd expect it too.

Wishlist
--------

- [ ] A one-click browser extension to get a random LGTM from the collection.
- [ ] A criteria for good LGTM images and remove all images that don't fulfill it.
